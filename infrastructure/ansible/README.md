# Quick and dirty Ansible example

Here is a simple playbook that can be used to deploy the backend to an Ubuntu host, using the "old-fashioned way" (local install).

**Usage example**
```bash
ansible-playbook -i a.b.c.d, -u azureuser backend-playbook.yml
```

The primary purpose of this directory is to showcase what Ansible is, and to serve as a discussion ground for its advantages and disadvantages.
